## ðŸš¨ **Risk Mitigation & Rollback Plan**

### **If Migration Fails:**
1. **Immediate Rollback**: Revert DNS to point back to Vercel
2. **Debug Time**: Allow 2-4 hours to fix DigitalOcean issues
3. **Retry**: Attempt migration again with lessons learned

### **Backup Strategy:**
- âœ… Keep Vercel deployment active until migration confirmed successful
- âœ… Have DNS rollback plan ready
- âœ… Screenshot all current configurations

---

## ðŸ’° **Cost Impact**

### **Current (Vercel)**:
- Free tier: $0/month
- Custom domain: Included

### **New (DigitalOcean)**:
