# Claude 4 Sonnet Self-Execution Review Protocol
## Smart Chunking Implementation Validation

### EXECUTION DIRECTIVE
**I (Claude 4 Sonnet) will systematically execute this comprehensive review using available tools to validate the smart chunking implementation completeness and correctness.**

### TOOL USAGE STRATEGY
- `read_file` for code structure verification
- `grep` for pattern matching and completeness checks  
- `run_terminal_cmd` for testing server status and functionality
- `codebase_search` for semantic analysis of implementation
- Parallel tool calls for efficiency

- [ ] Initial 500 companies load successfully
- [ ] Console shows "Smart chunking initialization complete" message
- [ ] Console shows industry coverage validation results

**Industry Coverage Validation:**
- [ ] Open Developer Tools → Console
- [ ] Look for "Industry Coverage Validation" messages
- [ ] Verify "159/159 (100.0%)" coverage is reported
- [ ] Check for any "FAILED" or "missing industries" error messages

### 2.2 Filter Functionality Testing
**Test all industry filters work immediately:**

**Industry Dropdown Testing:**
- [ ] Click on Industries dropdown
- [ ] Select "Computer System Design Services" → should show results immediately
- [ ] Select "Mortgage and Credit" → should show results immediately  
- [ ] Select "Real Estate Agents and Brokers" → should show results immediately
- [ ] Select "Dentists" → should show results immediately
- [ ] Try 5-10 random industries → all should show results immediately
- [ ] No "No companies found" messages for any industry

**Search Functionality:**
- [ ] Search works across all company data (not just visible)
- [ ] Search + Industry filter combination works
- [ ] Results appear instantly (<200ms response time)

### 2.3 Infinite Scroll Testing
**Verify progressive loading works correctly:**

**Scroll Behavior:**
- [ ] Scroll to bottom of company list
- [ ] "Loading more companies..." appears
- [ ] Additional 500 companies load automatically
- [ ] Scroll performance is smooth (no lag)
- [ ] Debug info (if in dev mode) shows correct statistics

**Loading States:**
- [ ] Loading spinner appears during fetch
- [ ] "All X companies loaded" message appears when complete
