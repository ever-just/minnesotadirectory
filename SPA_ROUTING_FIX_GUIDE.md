# SPA Routing Fix - Page Refresh 404 Error Solution

## Problem Identified

Your Minnesota Directory application was experiencing a common Single Page Application (SPA) issue where refreshing the page on client-side routes (like `/company/UnitedHealth%20Group%20Incorporated`) would result in a "Page not found" error.

### Why This Happens

1. **Client-Side Routing**: Your React app uses `BrowserRouter` from React Router, which creates clean URLs
2. **Server Request**: When a user refreshes the page, the browser makes a GET request to the server for that exact path
3. **Missing Server Route**: The server doesn't know about these client-side routes, so it returns a 404 error

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Vite Configuration

Cleaned up the `vite.config.ts` to ensure proper building without errors. Vite automatically handles SPA routing in development mode.

### 2. Added Production Deployment Configuration Files

Created multiple configuration files to handle SPA routing on different hosting platforms:

#### For Netlify Deployment (`public/_redirects`)
```
# Netlify redirects for SPA routing
/*    /index.html   200
```

#### For Vercel Deployment (`vercel.json`)
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### For Apache Servers (`.htaccess`)
```apache
Options -MultiViews
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]
```

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)
1. Build your project: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to Netlify
3. The `_redirects` file will automatically handle SPA routing

### Option 2: Vercel
1. Build your project: `npm run build`
2. Deploy using Vercel CLI or GitHub integration
3. The `vercel.json` file will handle routing

### Option 3: Apache Server
1. Build your project: `npm run build`
2. Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to your server
3. Ensure the `.htaccess` file is included (copy from project root to your server)

### Option 4: Manual Server Configuration
For other hosting providers, configure your server to:
- Serve static files normally
- For all other requests (404s), serve `index.html` instead
- This allows React Router to handle the routing client-side

## Testing the Fix

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
The development server automatically handles SPA routing.

### Production Mode (Local Testing)
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
This will serve the production build locally for testing.

## Verification Steps

1. Start your application
2. Navigate to a company detail page (e.g., `/company/Some%20Company%20Name`)
3. Refresh the page using Ctrl+F5 (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
4. The page should reload correctly without showing "Page not found"

## Files Modified/Added

- ✅ `vite.config.ts` - Cleaned up configuration
- ✅ `public/_redirects` - Netlify SPA routing
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Vercel SPA routing
- ✅ `.htaccess` - Apache SPA routing

## Additional Notes

- These configuration files ensure your application works correctly when deployed
- The routing fix maintains SEO-friendly URLs
- No changes were needed to your React Router configuration
- All existing functionality remains intact

Your application should now handle page refreshes correctly on all routes!
